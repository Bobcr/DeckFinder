# RoyaleAlchemist

Royale Alchemist is an unofficial Clash Royale helper, fully written in Swift, 99.9% using SwiftUI.

I tried to make the project relatively easy to navigate, and clean, but i generally don't follow any special architectural patterns like MVVM.

Feel free to ask questions about why or how or ... i've done things in the project.
