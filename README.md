# RoyaleAlchemist
Royale Alchemist is an unofficial Clash Royale helper, fully written in Swift, 99.9% using SwiftUI.

I tried to make the project relatively easy to navigate, and clean, but i generally don't follow any special architectural patterns like MVVM.

This app is no longer available on the App Store, and is no longer maintained.
